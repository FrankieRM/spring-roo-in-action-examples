Spring AJAX example - DOJO
----------------------------------------------------

This example project uses Dojo and Spring MVC to
provide an AJAX version of the Course scaffold.

We did the following:

1.  Generated the scaffold
2.  Pushed-in all methods of the CourseController aspect
3.  Replaced the views with the Dojo/Ajax versions
4.  Added the @RooJson annotation to the Course object
5.  Used Dojo in replacement views to render and perform
    activities.  The edit/update forms use Dojo and share
    the same form fields, using nested tiles (see the 
    views.xml file in the courses view directory).

Enjoy,

Ken
