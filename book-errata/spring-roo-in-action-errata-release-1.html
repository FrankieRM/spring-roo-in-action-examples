      <p>This is a list of errata that has been found and / or corrected in each release of Spring Roo</p>

      <p>Readers: If you find a problem with the text of the book, please log onto our author forum at <a href="http://manning.com/SpringRooInAction">http://manning.com/SpringRooInAction</a>. Please review this list below before you post, and check the e-book if you downloaded it to see if the issue has been corrected before you post. </p>

      <p>If you need to log a bug against the code samples, please create a GitHub account at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, and watch krimple's spring-roo-in-action-examples repo at <a href="https://github.com/krimple/spring-roo-in-action-examples">https://github.com/krimple/spring-roo-in-action-examples</a>, and file a bug by clicking on the Issues tab. We'll take a look at it as soon as we can. Please only log bugs if you can reproduce them, and they seem to truly represent a problem with the code as it currently exists.</p>

      <p>Important note: The samples may diverge from the book code naturally as a result of an error in the original samples (documented below) or because of upgrades to Roo that break the examples. We will provide tags representing release dates and will be attempting to document everything as much</p>
      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <ul>
      <li><h3>Code samples - Added to the end of paragraph 1</h3>
      
      <p>"Review the root directory of each source project. If it contains a readme.txt file, please review it before running the sample. This file may contain instructions on how to build, run, or review the individual sample."</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>About this book...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>p. xxvii - Added Gordon Dickens' last name...</h3>
          <p>Gordon's last name was missing from the credits for the STS RefCard.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>p. xxix - Add comment about readme.txt files</h3>
          <p>Since the Roo API changes periodically and the book may 
            become out of sync with examples, we use the convention 
            of a readme.txt file in the root of a sample project to 
            convey any late breaking changes not in the manuscript.
            Added a comment about this on this page.</p>
            </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>All Chapters</h2>
      <ul>
      <li><h3>Added package to <code>jetty:run</code> Maven commands</h3>
      <p>Changed from <pre>mvn jetty:run</pre> to <pre>mvn package jetty:run</pre> to reflect the recent updates to the jetty maven plugin (which no longer runs package automatically). Pages affected include p 13, 32, 135, 155, 231, 303. Also changed <pre>mvn tomcat:run</pre> to <pre>mvn package tomcat:run</pre> where encountered.</p></li>
      <li><h3>Cleaned up code sample formatting</h3>
        <p>Throughout the book code samples have been cleaned up as 
          code indentation was skewed when transformed into the final
          manuscript.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Page 7</h3>
          <p>Changed jdbcTemplate example to use <code>queryForInt</code> rather than <code>queryForString</code></p>
        </li>
        
      <li><h3>page 13</h3>
        <p>Added a note:  "Executing the Maven package goal guarantees that you are running against the latest changes to your application"</p>
      </li>
      <li><h3>page 20</h3>
        <p>Cleaned up language in first and second full paragraph.</p>
      </li>
      <li><h3>Page 21</h3>
        <p>Removed DAO from text. We were describing a Data Access Layer, not
          a Data Access Object</p>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Page 22</h3>
            <p>Cleaned up sentence structure.</p>
            </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Page 32 - Psst.. If you're using Git</h3>
          <p>Remove the first line continuation arrow as it is a single line Roo command.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Page 33</h3>
            <p>Bolden the Roo command in the second code snippet of the page to make it stand out.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Page 43</h3>
            <p>The <pre>infrastructure roo></pre> prompt was incorrect and has been fixed to now state the prompt is <pre>taskmanager-data roo></pre></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Page 61</h3>
          <p>Inversed bolding of commands themselves and output. The output was bolded, almost pointing to the wrong thing. The commands are the center or focus here.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Page 74</h3>
            <p>Cleaned up formatting of code example. Some lines were not properly aligned with others of the same level of indentation</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Page 77</h3>
            <p>Pull back <code>c.setDescription(null);</code> to align with rest of the indented block</p>
          </li>          
          </ul>
      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <ul>

          <p>Code cleanup - first method line was incorrectly indented an extra space.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Page 103</h3>
          <p>Continuation arrow in initial snippet on page was too close to code sample line. Listing 4.4 indentation was wrong and is corrected.</p>
        </li>        
        <li>      
        <h3>Page 107</h3>
        <p>Corrected the annotation for addressLine2 to: @Size(min = 0, max = 40) to allow for a nullable value. It currently has a minimum size of 1.</p> 
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Page 118</h3>
        <p>Listing 4.6 code alignment issues have been corrected.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ul>      
      <li><h3>p. 142 - Missing fields in later examples</h3>
        <p>Added the listPrice field to Listing 5.5. Added after the description table:column tag and before the maximumCapacity tag:</p>
       <pre>
       &lt;table:column 
          id=&quot;c_org_rooinaction_coursemanager_model_Course_listPrice&quot; 
          property=&quot;listPrice&quot;
          z=&quot;I0Pv164k6o5/Ts1K+c2DMlwD1KE=&quot;/&gt;
          </pre>
      </li>
    
          <li><h3>Page 143 - missing List Price field in listing 5.7</h3>
            <p>Updated snapshot of listing page to include listPrice
         <p>Added field:input between description and maximumCapacity field: tags as shown:</p>
         <pre>
        &lt;field:input decimalMax=&quot;99999.00&quot; decimalMin=&quot;0.0&quot;    
           field=&quot;listPrice&quot; 
           id=&quot;c_org_rooinaction_coursemanager_model_Course_listPrice&quot; 
           required=&quot;true&quot; 
           validationMessageCode=&quot;field_invalid_number&quot;

        <ul><h3>Page 165 - locale sample</h3>
          <p>Page 165 - locale sample before 6.2.5 - replaced sample below "In your view:" with this:</p>
          <pre>
      &lt;table:column date=&quot;true&quot; dateTimePattern=&quot;${short.date.format}&quot;
        id=&quot;c_org_rooinaction_coursemanager_model_Offering_runDate&quot;
        property=&quot;runDate&quot; z=&quot;user-managed&quot;/&gt;
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Page 165</h3>
          <p>Just below the sample in the last bullet, but before "Roo may also have problems..." added a quick note that states: "Refer to the chapter 6 coursemanager exampleâ€™s list.jspx file for the offering entity for an example"</p>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Page 166</h3>
            <p>Paragraph before second bullet. Added to end of paragraph "To populate the list, you can use something like this:" - then embed informal snippet with one line:</p>

uiModel.addAttribute("coursetypeenums", (line broken on errata only)
   Arrays.asList(CourseTypeEnum.values()));
