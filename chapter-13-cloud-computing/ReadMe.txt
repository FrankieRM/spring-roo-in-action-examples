Build and Deploy the Sample Application to the Cloud:
--------------------------------------------------------


To build and deploy the sample application, you can use the sample code from one of the previous chapters (e.g. chapter-08-security) and run the build commands to compile and package the application from the directory of that chapter.


And then you can use Roo Cloud Foundry Add-on commands listed in chapter-13_CloudComputing_RooCommands.roo file to deploy the application to the cloud and test it using the remote server URL.
