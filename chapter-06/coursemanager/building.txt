To build this project, due to the use of the snapshot version of Spring
Roo, you need to download the Roo source code and perform a mvn install.
You can get the master branch of the Roo source code from github at 

  https://github.com/springsource/spring-roo

Follow the instructions in the readme file (including installing a pgp
key) to set up your local builds.

Then, once you perform a mvn install of the Spring Roo project, you'll
be able to build this project.

Once the Roo 1.2-M2 build comes out, we'll switch our projects to that
(hopefully more stable) build.
